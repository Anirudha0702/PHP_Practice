The administration ensures that all stakeholders are provided with a level playing field and special care is taken to address the needs of the physically- challenged. The administration has taken extra pains to ensure that a physically-challenged student who is keen to continue his/her education   is allowed to do so even though that meant getting special permission from the affiliating University. Different Depts. have started social outreach programmes by which they try to reach out to the sections of the society with special needs.</p></div>
